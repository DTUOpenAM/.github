## üöÄ Welcome to the Open AM Initiative!

The **Open Additive Manufacturing Initiative (Open AM)** is an open-source project that aims to fundamentally transform industrial additive manufacturing (AM). Focused specifically on the advanced process of **Laser Powder-bed Fusion (L-PBF)**, and **Vat photopolymerisation (VPP)** Open AM sets out to address the proprietary constraints, high costs, and limited accessibility that currently dominate these fields.

Additive Manufacturing has emerged as a disruptive technology in industries such as aerospace, healthcare, and automotive, enabling unparalleled design freedom, customization, and performance optimization. However, the manufacturing promise of AM is often restricted by the proprietary nature of these industrial systems, which impose limitations on research, innovation, and material exploration. Open AM challenges this by fostering an open-source, community-driven approach to AM technology development.

The industrial Additive Manufacturing (AM) industry is dominated by restrictive business models that significantly limit user control and innovation. Many AM systems are tied to proprietary software requiring costly and recurring license renewals, effectively locking users into ongoing expenses just to operate their machines. Material usage is often restricted through ID-tagging systems, where manufacturers enforce the use of expensive, branded powders, dramatically upmarking costs compared to equivalent open-market materials. Additionally, process parameters‚Äîcritical for experimentation and optimization‚Äîare frequently closed off, preventing users from exploring novel applications or materials. Maintenance contracts add another layer of dependence, as some providers enforce exclusive agreements for servicing, often at steep prices. In extreme cases, ownership of the machine is ambiguous; rather than fully controlling the equipment, users find themselves in arrangements where the solution provider essentially operates the machine on their behalf, right on the factory floor. These practices stifle innovation and make advanced AM technology prohibitively expensive and inaccessible for general purpose manufacturing, for smaller companies, researchers, and innovators. Open AM seeks to dismantle these barriers, building an ecosystem that prioritizes user freedom, transparency, and collaboration.

This initiative is **driven by a mission to democratize access to cutting-edge additive manufacturing technologies**, empowering researchers, educators and industries to engage in innovation without being hindered by high entry costs or restrictive business- and licensing agreements. Open AM embraces principles of **collaboration**, **modularity**, and **transparency**, making it a catalyst for progress in the field of AM.

Hosted by the **Technical University of Denmark (DTU)**, this initiative represents the culmination of **five years of rigorous research, development, and testing**. Funded by the visionary **Poul Due Jensen Foundation**, Open AM is a testament to the transformative potential of open science and engineering. By leveraging an interdisciplinary approach that combines mechanical engineering, materials science, systems design, and software development, Open AM delivers an ecosystem of tools, systems, and knowledge to accelerate the adoption of L-PBF technology.

The Open AM repository is much more than a bundle of files ‚Äì it is a **your collective for innovation**. It provides everything from hardware blueprints and software suites to firmware solutions and academic insights, all under permissive open-source licenses. This transparency is intended to:
- **Enable exploration**: Researchers and engineers can use Open AM tools to study and develop new processes, materials, and designs.
- **Foster collaboration**: Open AM invites global participation, creating a vibrant community of contributors who can share improvements, ideas, and discoveries.
- **Expand accessibility**: By significantly reducing the cost of entry, Open AM opens the door for smaller organizations, academic institutions, and individuals to access advanced AM technology.

The initiative is built on several pillars:
1. **Hardware**: Modular, cost-efficient, high-performance designs for L-PBF systems and sub-systems.
2. **Software**: Comprehensive control suites and data visualization tools that integrate seamlessly with the hardware.
3. **Documentation**: Meticulously detailed guides for assembly, use, and modification to ensure ease of adoption.
4. **Community**: A global network of developers, researchers, and users collaborating to push the boundaries of AM innovation.

With a focus on **long-term impact**, Open AM not only equips users with the tools to innovate today but also lays the groundwork for a sustainable, community-driven future in additive manufacturing. The initiative bridges the gap between research and application, ensuring that the benefits of advanced manufacturing technology are accessible to all. It serves as a call to action for the AM community to join forces and redefine the future of manufacturing through openness, ingenuity, and collaboration.
