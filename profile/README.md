### What you will find
The Open AM profile owns several repositories each containing the documentation about specific systems or sub-systems. These repos are a mixture of hardware, software, firmware, etc. Some of the repos are dependencies of other sub-systems, some will be main repos that link the dependencies, and some will be more standalone.
